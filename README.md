# MNIST Digit Classification Project

This project demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, with 60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 images in the test set. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image. This project uses a CNN to classify the digits with high accuracy.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python packages:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bbakac/MNIST-Digit-Classifier.git
cd MNIST-Digit-Classifier

Install the required packages manually if not using a requirements file:
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib


Usage
Run the project with the following command:
python mnist_classification.py
